Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

*   Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)

*   Git

### 1. Clone the Repository

\`\`\`bash

cd AI-Powered-Web-App
\`\`\`

### 2. Install Dependencies

\`\`\`bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
\`\`\`
*Note: The \`--legacy-peer-deps\` flag is used to resolve potential peer dependency conflicts with React 19 Release Candidates.*

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a \`.env.local\` file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables. You can use \`.env.example\` as a template.

\`\`\`plaintext
# Database - Replace with your actual MongoDB connection string
DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-name>.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority"

# Supabase - Replace with your actual Supabase project values
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key

# Groq API - Your provided API key
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY

\`\`\`

*   **MongoDB Setup:** Ensure you have a MongoDB Atlas cluster set up and replace `<username>`, `<password>`, `<cluster-name>`, and `<dbname>` with your actual database credentials.
*   **Supabase Setup:** Create a Supabase project and configure authentication (e.g., Email Magic Link). Get your project URL and Anon Key from your Supabase project settings.
*   **Groq API Key:** Obtain an API key from Groq and replace `gsk_YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY`.

### 4. Initialize Prisma and Push Schema

After configuring your `DATABASE_URL`, initialize Prisma and push your schema to MongoDB:

\`\`\`bash
npm run db:generate
npm run db:push
\`\`\`

### 5. Run the Development Server

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application.
